# Only exclude test files from dist
# This is used in conjunction with the "files" field in package.json
# which is already restricting the published files to dist, README.md, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG.md

# Test files that might be in the dist directory
dist/**/*.spec.js
dist/**/*.spec.d.ts
dist/**/*.test.js
dist/**/*.test.d.ts
